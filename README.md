## ü§î Development Approach & Decisions

This project was developed with a focus on modern web standards, reusability, and a clean user experience.

1.  **Component-Driven Architecture:**
    *   The application is broken down into small, reusable components (e.g., `StatCard`, `Sidebar`, `AddEmployeeModal`). This approach makes the codebase easier to manage, test, and scale.
    *   Pages (like `DashboardHome` and `EmployeeListPage`) are used to compose these components into meaningful views.

2.  **Utility-First CSS with Tailwind:**
    *   I chose Tailwind CSS to enable rapid development and maintain a consistent design system without writing custom CSS files. This allows for quick iteration on UI elements and ensures that components are styled consistently across the application. The `tailwind.config.js` file was customized to include the project's specific color palette (e.g., `primary`, `light-bg`).

3.  **Client-Side Routing:**
    *   `react-router-dom` was used to handle all navigation within the app. A protected route structure was implemented in `App.js` to ensure that users must be authenticated to access the dashboard, providing a layer of security.

4.  **Data Visualization with Recharts:**
    *   For the "Employee Activity" chart on the dashboard, I chose the `recharts` library. It's a powerful and composable charting library for React that made it easy to create a visually appealing and informative bar chart that closely matched the design mockups.

5.  **Modal Implementation with React Portals:**
    *   The "Add New Employee" modal was built using `ReactDOM.createPortal`. This is a best practice in React for rendering modals, as it attaches the modal to the root of the DOM, preventing complex z-index and CSS stacking context issues that can arise when a modal is nested deep inside other components.
